    - `brainstorming-session-results.md` — Session notes and trilogy ideation.
    - `book-1-structure.md` — Revised Book 1 plan with 8 Parts and 30 chapters (compressible to 24–26). Each chapter targets 5k–6k words.
    - `character.md` — Comprehensive character compendium with personas, backgrounds, and DharmaYuddha angles (core and extended cast).
    - `research.md` — Sources and rare variants to integrate (Harivamsa, Vedic, Jain/Buddhist, regional).
