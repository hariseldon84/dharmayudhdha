## Integration Notes
- Use CE as baseline for narrative fidelity; annotate divergences.
- For “startling” claims, ensure at least one primary or peer‑reviewed secondary source listed in `docs/research.md`.
- Regional/folk materials should be marked explicitly when used to enrich character motives or rituals.
- Archaeology references should be handled cautiously—present as debates, not certainties.

## Maintenance
- As `docs/research.md` grows toward 300+ links, update each chapter’s bullets with item numbers and new sources.
- Prefer deep links (chapter/section) when available in translations or CE apparatus.
