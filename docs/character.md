# DharmaYuddha — Character Compendium

Purpose: A comprehensive, evolving reference of Mahabharata characters — personas, background, relationships, notable deeds, deaths/fates, and angles relevant to our reimagined Book 1. Designed to be exhaustive and expandable.

Note: Canon varies across regional and textual traditions. This compendium synthesizes mainstream narrative with regional variants and scholarly summaries. We will adapt specifics to fit the DharmaYuddha arcs.
