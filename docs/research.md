# Mahabharata Research Dossier

Goal: Aggregate rare, conflicting, and suppressed narratives; primary sources; philological notes; regional retellings; scholarly papers; archaeology; epigraphy; and living oral traditions that inform Book 1 — The Parshurama Prophecy. This master list prioritizes credible, citable references. Each item includes a short note highlighting the “startling” or under-discussed angle where relevant.

Note on sourcing ethics: Where possible, we link to authoritative editions, archives, universities, and libraries. Many primary texts are under copyright or behind paywalls; links here point to catalogs, abstracts, or legitimate previews. Use library access or institutional subscriptions for full texts.

## Research Method Notes (for Book Integration)

- Prefer CE as baseline; mark deviations when using popular translations.
- Track “startling” claims to at least one primary or peer-reviewed secondary source; avoid hearsay.
- Use Harivamsha for early Krishna material; treat Bhagavata Purana as later devotional expansion.
- When invoking Jain/Buddhist parallels, state comparative function, not equivalence.
- Note oral/local traditions distinctly; avoid collapsing them into Sanskrit mainline without evidence.

**Next Steps:**
1. Begin systematic research of Harivamsa Purana
2. Compile Jain/Buddhist Mahabharata variations
3. Identify 10-15 "startling insights" to anchor the trilogy
4. Map rare facts to specific plot points and character arcs
