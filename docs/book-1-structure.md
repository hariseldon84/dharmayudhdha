## Word Count Plan

- Chapters 1–30: **5,000–6,000 words each** (minimum per chapter)  
- Recommended average: **5,500 words**  
- Total target range (30 chapters): **165,000–180,000 words**  
- If trimmed to 24 chapters (6 parts × 4 chapters): **132,000–144,000 words**

Note: We exceeded the original 90,000-minimum to match your 20–25+ chapter vision with robust pacing. If you want stricter 20–25 chapters, we can collapse Part VII–VIII into one and merge two chapters elsewhere to land at 24–26 chapters.

## Drafting Notes

- Multiple POVs per chapter to sustain dramatic irony.  
- Integrate `docs/research.md` insights as teachings, folklore, and technical details (Agneya methods, Jain/Buddhist moral lenses, Harivamsa episodes).  
- Keep Arjuna–Karna brotherhood secret as long-term irony; reveal beats as subtext, not exposition.  
- End Book 1 on the conspiracy reveal with Bheeshma’s strategic repositioning, setting up Book 2 escalation.

## Open Items To Define

- Drupad–Panchali political stakes and kinship clarity.  
- Specific articulation of Arjuna’s dharmasankat moment.  
- Karna’s future wife identity and meeting context.  
- Krishna’s romantic interest (e.g., Rukmini) and timing.  
- Mechanics of Shakuni & Dhritarashtra’s plot; Bheeshma’s precise counters.
